# 29 June 2018

There are three new repos I pushed up to the Nextstrain GitHub organization
yesterday:

* <https://github.com/nextstrain/zika>
* <https://github.com/nextstrain/cli>
* <https://github.com/nextstrain/docker-base>

Each has a readme that I think is a reasonable introduction, but I want to
explain a little about them here too.


## zika

This is my example of a per-pathogen Nextstrain build repository.  It contains
a Snakefile and all the necessary supporting files to download sequences from
fauna, run them through (modular) augur, and visualize them in auspice.  The
build started from a copy of `builds/zika/` in augur and was developed from
there.  My [suggested best practices for our Snakefiles][bestpractices] are
used.

If you have a suitable local Nextstrain environment with the following:

* all Python dependencies installed
* access to the necessary commands `augur`, `mafft`, and `iqtree`

then you can run the build on the example data (bypassing fauna) by doing:

    mkdir -p build/data/
    cp example_data/zika.fasta build/data/
    snakemake

The [zika readme][] describes how to add RethinkDB credentials for accessing
fauna to run the build on the live dataset.  You'll need to make sure that the
build has access to the fauna repository as `../fauna/` (that is, a sibling
directory of this repository).


## cli

I also made a `nextstrain` command which can be used to run and visualize
builds without requiring you set up a Python and JavaScript environment.

The tool is distributed as the Python 3 package `nextstrain-cli`, which you can
install with:

    pip3 install git+https://github.com/nextstrain/cli

Further instructions are in the [nextstrain-cli readme][].

You'll also need Docker installed.  You can download and install the [Docker
Community Edition (CE)][] for your platform for free.

Once you have both nextstrain-cli and docker installed, run:

    nextstrain check-setup

to make sure things look good.  Then run:

    nextstrain update

to download the image containing a complete Nextstrain environment.  This will
take a few minutes, but it only needs to be run the once to get the image (and
again later when you want to get updates).  It's within this image that the
build and tools like augur and auspice will be run.

To run the build, navigate to the zika repository and run:

    nextstrain build .

You can copy the example data into place first as shown earlier if you don't
want to add RethinkDB credentials.

When the build is complete, you should see all the output in the `build/`
directory, including auspice-compatible JSONs in `build/auspice/`.  You can
visualize the output in auspice by running:

    nextstrain view build/auspice/

and opening up [the URL](http://localhost:4000/zika) it prints.

This will work even if you run the build using snakemake directly without using
`nextstrain build`.


## docker-base

This is the repository containing the files for creating the Nextstrain base
image used by the `nextstrain` command above.  I won't say much more here.  You
can see the [docker-base readme][] for more info or ask me.
