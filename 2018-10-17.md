# or, a few thoughts on why we're not Big Data.

Far less than billions of records, less than even a million.

Data will be structured from the start.

We're collecting the data we expect to be salient, not hoovering up everything
to sort out later.

Easier to start with an RDBMS.  Always possible to copy data into Hadoop for
processing later if that ever becomes necessary (e.g. with Sqoop or other
tools).

Not doing natural-language processing (NLP).

Not doing neural nets.

The biggest difference between an RDBMS and something like Hadoop (HDFS,
really) which can ingest "any kind of data" is _when_ you are forced to project
structure onto your data: before or after.  It doesn't get around having to
project a structure of some sort in order to process it, nor does it get around
having to organize it so you can choose what to process.
