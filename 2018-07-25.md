# or, thoughts on a `nextstrain deploy` command.

Building upon my [previous thoughts about deployment](2018-07-19.md#deployment),
I sketched out some ideas below that have been running through my head.

_[Note that I'm fleshing those ideas out for this document several days later.]_

The following commands work on the [`deploy-command` PR][]:

    nextstrain deploy s3://nextstrain-staging zika/auspice/*.json
    nextstrain deploy s3://nextstrain-data    zika/auspice/*.json

You can also specify an arbitrary prefix to use at deploy time:

    nextstrain deploy s3://nextstrain-staging/trs_2018-07-25_ zika/auspice/*.json

and it'll be available at:

    http://staging.nextstrain.org/trs_2018-07-25_zika_meta.json
    http://staging.nextstrain.org/trs_2018-07-25_zika_tree.json
    ...

The `deploy` command does automatic discovery of CloudFront distributions
serving from the given S3 bucket and creates the necessary cache invalidations
without any need to specify the CloudFront distribution ids.  This includes
correct handling of any CloudFront distribution origin paths if serving from a
subpath within an S3 bucket.

## Future directions

It'd be nice in the future to support configuration files for deployment
targets, akin to git's configuration of remotes.  Something like:

    [deployment "prod"]
    url = s3://nextstrain-data
    cloudfront = E3LB0EWZKCCV

    [deployment "staging"]
    url = s3://nextstrain-staging
    cloudfront = auto

    [deployment "test"]
    url = s3://trs-blab-test/foo/bar

That config would enable running `deploy` commands like:

    nextstrain deploy prod    zika/auspice/*.json
    nextstrain deploy staging zika/auspice/*.json
    nextstrain deploy test    zika/auspice/*.json

The `cloudfront` config key can be omitted or set to `auto`, the default, to do
automatic discovery, or be explicitly set to prevent discovery (this might be
desirable in edge cases).
