I think things are in a reasonable place for me to go on leave for a few weeks
soon without my absence being an impediment to anything super time-sensitive.

If anything does catch fire, the quickest, most reliable way to reach me is to
text or call my cell phone (see the Slack directory).  It is 100% ok to reach
out that way.  For non-urgent matters, I will likely check Slack and Fred Hutch
email periodically.

Here's where things stand:

* __Additional yellow collection barcodes are needed for the start of community
  enrollment on 7 Jan.__

  This needs to happen before 7 Jan, and ideally by 2 Jan so we can get them
  into the hands of the study collection staff.

  The barcodes are quick to generate and labels quick to print, although as of
  yet no one but me has done this.  I should walk someone through it before I
  go on leave.  It currently requires command-line skills and access to [our
  git repo](https://github.com/zeXLc2p0/barcodes), so that someone may want to
  be Trevor.  The repo contains a README describing how to use the tools there.

  This is still pending only because I am hoping address the item below first.


* __Yellow collection barcodes should be made larger for better scanning by the
  enrollment app.__

  This ideally happens before 7¬†Jan and the item above, but worst case we start
  enrollment with the existing smaller format and suffer some scanning issues
  before moving to larger labels a few weeks later.

  The enrollment app is not very good at scanning barcodes with the camera.  In
  hands-on testing with Jenny, the tight barcode, sheen of the label material,
  tube curvature, and operator handling all seem to contribute to the poor
  performance.
  
  Scanning success rates are reasonable when the plane of the camera and plane
  of the barcode are parallel and held steady, but this is hard for some folks
  to do reliably.

  We determined that increasing the size of the barcode along with setting a
  fixed focal length on the camera helped mitigate scanning issues, although
  even so its not perfect.  Manual barcode entry is possible, so that's our
  worst-case fallback.  The barcode can also be scanned before being affixed to
  the tube (after being pulled off the sheet to avoid mis-scans), but the label
  material isn't changeable because of its cryo-safe properties.

  The plan is to switch to LCRY-1100 (or maybe LCRY-1200) labels for the yellow
  collection barcodes and generate barcodes which are 1cm tall (instead of
  0.5cm) and use a 0.3mm width scaling factor (instead of 0.16mm).


* __Retrospective clinical data pulls need a meeting with Helen, Izzy, and Amalia
  to move them forward.__

  Ideally we could meet before I go on leave, but folks may be out of town.
  Otherwise, you can all meet in my absence, or we can do it shortly after I
  come back.

  What we want is for them to use the same data dictionary the enrollment app
  is using when coding clinical data variables for our use.  I've extracted the
  data dictionary the app will use as of today‚Äîit may change slightly in the
  coming weeks‚Äîas [plain text](https://github.com/zeXLc2p0/documentation/blob/master/survey-data-dictionary.txt)
  and [JSON](https://github.com/zeXLc2p0/documentation/blob/master/survey-data-dictionary.json).


* __Hiring for the developer and bioinformatician roles is stalled.__

  Ideally this keeps moving in my absence, with the caveat that I would like to
  participate in interviews and have a say in final decisions since I'll be
  leading this team.

  I let this fall by the wayside for a bit after being somewhat demoralized by
  the first go round and feeling pressure to get some infrastructure
  (barcoding, receiving enrollment documents, standing up test instances)
  in place for December residuals and January new enrollments.

  Next steps on my list to pick this back up again:

  - Contact promising applicants from the first go round
  - Post ad on ZipRecruiter
  - Post ad on Indeed
  - Review second round of LinkedIn applicants
  - See if we got any applicants via the Fred Hutch site


* __Research schema and enrollment ETL needs to move behind my local prototypes.__

  This can wait until my return.

  We don't even have test enrollment documents or test clinical data yet, and
  it will likely be some time still until we do.  The production data that is
  collected should be able to sit tight for a bit without causing any
  downstream effects.  Mike has simulated data for pushing the modeling
  forward, so we're not blocking him.


* __Infrastructure needs to move from AWS to Azure.__

  This can wait until my return.

  AWS was my choice to get things going only because of familiarity.  I've
  intentionally gone very light on AWS-specific usage, so bits should port to
  Azure pretty much 1:1.

  - Setup Azure subscription/tenancy.  Is this via the Fred Hutch tenancy or our own?
  - Describe [our current infrastructure](https://github.com/zeXLc2p0/documentation/blob/master/infrastructure.md)
    in terms of [Ansible](https://ansible.com) and [Terraform](https://terraform.io).
  - Shut down AWS account after success migration.


* __Workflow engine choices are in a holding pattern.__

  ‚Ä¶and that's ok for now.  Not urgent.
  
  We can build out pipelines in Snakemake/nextflow and port those to whatever
  platform we choose (likely through automated conversion to CWL).  The
  pipelines themselves are still a middle-distance need.

  My gut says we want to go with Arvados on Azure, managed by Curoverse.


* __Samplify integration is in a holding pattern.__

  This can wait until my return.

  Next steps to pick this back up again:

  - Reconnect with Jeff at NWGC with details about proposed integration for
    diagnostics and sequencing results.
  - Implement API endpoints for Samplify to hit.
  - Test test test.


* __Reportable condition notification is in a holding pattern.__

  This can wait until my return.

  Moot until we start getting diagnostic results, which seem a long way off
  still.  My plan is to setup alerts in Metabase which either remotely trigger
  or directly perform [the actions to start the notification
  process](https://seattle-flu-study.slack.com/archives/CEDQ94EKF/p1543988017012400).
