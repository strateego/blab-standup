# or, Charon: A data API for Auspice

## Current

The Charon API, [as described in the white-labelling docs][api doc], relies on
a dynamic server able to respond to the following endpoints:

    /charon/getAvailable
    /charon/getAvailable?prefix=flu_seasonal

    /charon/getDataset?prefix=flu_seasonal_h3n2_ha_2y
    /charon/getDataset?prefix=flu_seasonal_h3n2_ha_2y&type=tip-frequencies

    /charon/getNarrative?prefix=flu-report-2018-Q3.md

Pros:

* Server allows for custom logic to dynamically respond with different datasets
  for different people (e.g. logged in users).

Cons:

* Requires a dynamic server.

* Statically-hosted builds (e.g. for GitHub Pages) and S3-served builds (e.g.
  for Nextstrain) must be special-cased since no dynamic server is possible.

* Paths in the user-facing URL require transformation back and forth, which
  historically has been a source of bugs.

## Proposed

My proposed "data API" is to use standard HTTP access for what it's good at by
changing Auspice to request these URLs instead:

    /datasets.json
    /narratives.json

    /dataset/${datasetPath}/${type}.json
    /dataset/flu/seasonal/h3n2/ha/2y/{tree,meta,tip-frequencies}.json

    /narrative/${name}.json
    /narrative/flu-report/2018/Q3.md

Pros:

* These endpoints can either be provided by a set of files on a static host by
  default or by a dynamic server in order to customize responses for different
  people (e.g.  logged in users).

* Statically-hosted builds (e.g. for GitHub Pages) and S3-served builds (e.g.
  for Nextstrain) just work with no special-casing or additional server logic
  in Auspice.

* Paths in the user-facing URL match those behind the scenes without
  any transformation.

* Standard HTTP caching strategies work without a custom server complicating
  it.

Cons:

_I don't see any downsides to this approach, but maybe you do?  Looking for
feedback!_
