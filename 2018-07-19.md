# 19 July 2018

Yesterday I wrote up my thoughts on future directions for the [Nextstrain
CLI](https://github.com/nextstrain/cli).  I posted them to [the discussion
about the remit of the CLI](https://github.com/nextstrain/cli/issues/6#issuecomment-406448959),
but I also wanted to preserve them here.

---

Here's where my brain is at regarding future directions for the CLI, by way of
examples that are hopefully mostly self-explanatory.  Please ask for clarification
where the examples are unclear!  Each example shows only the relevant options
and arguments, but options from each section may be combined in any way
desired.


### Deployment

    nextstrain deploy s3://nextstrain-staging auspice/*.json
    nextstrain deploy s3://nextstrain-data    auspice/*.json


### Build directory locations

    nextstrain build .
    nextstrain build /fh/fast/bedford_t/zika
    nextstrain build https://github.com/nextstrain/zika
    nextstrain build https://github.com/nextstrain/zika#some-branch

Remote git repos may want to follow pip's lead and use URLs like
`git+https://github.com/nextstrain/zika` instead (with the leading `git+`).


### Build execution locations

    nextstrain build                (defaults to --docker)
    nextstrain build --docker
    nextstrain build --singularity
    nextstrain build --aws
    nextstrain build --local        (runs outside any container image,
                                     in whatever the current environment is,
                                     e.g. conda, virtualenv, etc)


### Remote components (--augur, --auspice, etc)?

Components within the container image can be replaced on demand using the
--augur, --auspice, etc options.  Currently they only work with local
filesystem paths, as in the first line below, but it might be desirable to
support remote locations as well for testing/development purposes.

    nextstrain build --augur ~/blab/augur/
    nextstrain build --augur https://github.com/nextstrain/augur
    nextstrain build --augur https://github.com/nextstrain/augur#some-branch


### Remote build experience

One idea for how remote builds might work interface-wise:

    $ nextstrain build --aws .
    Starting build of ~/nextstrain/zika on AWS Batch…

    Results will be available at:

        https://.../37c0d9d765dc17fda57225759a98b4dc2599a6d3/

    You can fetch them using:

        nextstrain fetch-build 37c0d9d765dc17fda57225759a98b4dc2599a6d3

    or by using build's --fetch option next time.


    $ nextstrain fetch-build 37c0d9d765dc17fda57225759a98b4dc2599a6d3
    Waiting for build to finish…

    Downloading auspice/zika_tree.json
    Downloading auspice/zika_meta.json
    Downloading data/zika.fasta
    Downloading results/aligned.fasta.log
    Downloading results/filtered.fasta
    Downloading results/aligned.fasta.pre_aligner.fasta
    Downloading results/country.mugration_model.txt
    ...


or as one step:

    $ nextstrain build --aws --fetch .
    Starting build of ~/nextstrain/zika on AWS Batch…

    Results will be available at:

        https://.../37c0d9d765dc17fda57225759a98b4dc2599a6d3/

    Waiting for build to finish…

    Downloading auspice/zika_tree.json
    Downloading auspice/zika_meta.json
    Downloading data/zika.fasta
    Downloading results/aligned.fasta.log
    Downloading results/filtered.fasta
    Downloading results/aligned.fasta.pre_aligner.fasta
    Downloading results/country.mugration_model.txt
    ...


### Smoke testing several builds remotely after augur changes

James wants to be able to smoke test several or all pathogen builds after
pushing up an augur topic/feature branch.  Using some of the primitives
sketched out above, that might be accomplished by something like:

    parallel \
        nextstrain build --aws --fetch --augur https://github.com/nextstrain/augur#some-branch \
            https://github.com/nextstrain/{} \
        ::: zika tb WNV mumps

which could be added to a local alias or otherwise wrapped up into another
command.

We could use a similar command in a Travis CI config to automatically
smoke-test builds when augur changes.

### Paths

I think that all commands should take explicit paths to local/remote files
(hence things like `auspice/*.json` or `.` or `https://github.com/...` above).
However, it might be desirable to add some conventional defaults if no explicit
paths are given to a command that expects them.  For `deploy`, that might be
automatically looking at all `*.json` files in an `auspice/` subdirectory.  For
`build` that might be assuming the current directory.  The disadvantage is
that, while the surficial syntax is nicer, it makes it harder to explain when
the defaults apply and when they don't.  Explicit-ness has a nice way of being
more apparent what's happening.
