# 26 June 2018

Trevor asked me to update the group with what I've been up to so everyone knows
what's going on and is on the same page.  I'll try to do this regularly!

The twin goals I've been working towards are:
  
  * starting to do automated testing of pathogen builds when
    sacra/augur/auspice/etc changes.

  * making it easier to get started tweaking and experimenting with a pathogen
    build

These have manifested as three primary tasks, all of them interconnected:

 1. A base Nextstrain container image for running automated pathogen builds
    inside a fully-defined, known-good environment.

    Currently the image is built for [Docker][], but it should be
    straightforward to adapt/import it as an [rkt][] image if we want platform
    diversity.  We should also be able to use the image with [Singularity][] to
    run in non-containerized environment, like a cluster.  This may be
    important for pathogens like flu, which are large builds.

 2. Per-pathogen repositories containing everything for a single pathogen build.
 
    The idea is to extract all of the pathogen-specific bits from Nextstrain
    components like augur and put each pathogen into its own git repository.
    This separates concerns and intends to make it easier to get started with
    or test a pathogen build.  Core pathogen repositories would be published
    at, for example, <https://github.com/nextstrain/zika>.  As a future bonus
    goal, we could support community-contributed pathogen builds published
    elsewhere.  One way to do this might be:
    
        https://github.com/fda/noro â†’ https://hub.nextstrain.org/fda/noro

    but there are many others and it warrants further discussion.

    For demonstration and development purposes, I've been working on an example
    per-pathogen repository using zika.  This started as a copy of an early
    version of James' modular augur zika build.  It has since diverged a bit to
    support greater configurability and demonstrate practices I think will
    enhance maintainability.  All of my changes are reconcilable with
    subsequent discussion and changes on augur's `zika` branch, and I'll take
    responsibility for working those out.

 3. A Nextstrain command-line interface for running pathogen builds and viewing
    results in auspice.

    This is to abstract away the details of using the container image to run
    builds or run auspice.  Its design is extensible to supporting running
    builds locally as well.  My intent is for this to be a well-honed,
    easy-to-use, user-facing tool, but it is also suitable for automating
    testing of pathogen builds.

I've had drafts of these three pieces for a bit now and have been refining and
adjusting the way they interact and function.  I hope to have something
people can try out themselves this week.


## On the backburner

One identified, longer-term goal that's related to the above but currently not
the focus of my attention is making it possible/easier for folks to bring their
own data into auspice by showing up with a FASTA file and a set of metadata
(TSV, JSON, anything tabular).  This aims to position Nextstrain as an
accessible web-based tool for people's own data, in addition to our curated
pathogen builds informing research and public health.  Tasks I see for this
include:

  * Create a generic FASTA + metadata "pathogen" build which produces
    reasonable output for auspice.  At this point, people could use the
    nextstrain CLI to push their data through the build and view it in auspice
    locally.

  * Create a web-based system to accept the FASTA + metadata input files,
    schedule a build using the above, and make available the results online.
    This approaches the ease-of-use that might get people using it more widely.

  * Create a JSON Schema for augur's output / auspice's input so that we can
    validate these data files early and often.

All of these tasks and the overall goal will need further discussion,
investigation of specifics, and refinement of goals vs. non-goals.
