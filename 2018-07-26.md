_[Note that I'm fleshing out these jotted down notes several days later.]_

Following up on conversations with Trevor during my first week, I looked into
[the data durability guarantees of S3 as well as its versioning
feature](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/#Durability_.26_Data_Protection).

The gist of the linked page and discussion elsewhere online is that while
Amazon is very unlikely to lose your data, they're only human and it's happened
in the past!  They also can't prevent us from making a mistake and accidentally
deleting all the files in a bucket or the bucket itself.  The official
recommendation is to ensure you have second-system (i.e. not on S3!) backups of
any precious/hard-to-recreate S3 data.  This seems sane to me, and we should
consider what fits that description.

Versioning of S3 objects doesn't help with the risk of Amazon/S3 suffering data
loss, but it _does_ help us recover from mistakes like accidental deletion or
bad updates that corrupt the data files before we realize.  Turning on
versioning for a bucket means that all copies of an object are stored, even if
the object is later deleted.  While the most recent version is always served,
it's possible to rollback to previous versions for recovery.  Permanently
deleting all the past copies (versions) of an object is quite hard to do
accidentally.
