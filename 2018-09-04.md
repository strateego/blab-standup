# or, A roadmap for Nextstrain?

Trevor initiated discussion with James, Sidney, and myself (Thomas) on Tuesday
morning about where to take Nextstrain in light of his previous discussions
with CDC and other groups.

Lots of ideas and thoughts were bandied about, but we seemed to reach some
broad takeaways that we could all agree would be worth continuing to discuss.

The key takeaway proposals were to:

* Re-focus nextstrain.org on real-time, global outlooks on disease as reference
  analyses primarily aimed at public health communities.

* Create a de-branded, lightweight website (_viz.website_ below) for
  visualizing everything else.

We thought through each of the situations to reach these takeaways:

Group           | Organism    | Location under proposed changes           | Notes
-----           | --------    | -------------------------------           | -----
CDC             | flu         | nextstrain.org/flu                        | Maintained by us in collaboration by CDC
CDC             | malaria     | nextstrain.org/malaria                    | Maintained by CDC
CDC             | mumps       | nextstrain.org/mumps                      | Maintained by CDC
ARTIC           | _various_   | artic.network and private servers         |
Grubaugh Lab    | WNV         | _viz.website_/grubaughlab/WNV             |
Paul            | lassa       | _viz.website_/pauloluniyi/lassa           |
Shirlee         | mumps       | _viz.website_/f79304a…                    | Static analysis as a supplement to a publication
Alli            | zika (USVI) | _viz.website_/blab/zika-usvi              | Analysis as a supplement to publications
Sidney          | dengue      | _viz.website_/blab/dengue                 |
Beth            | bison       | _viz.website_/…                           | Non-pathogenic data has a home too!


## Changes to nextstrain.org

Re-focusing nextstrain.org would mean:

* **Removing nextstrain.org/community URLs.**  The intent is for such community
  builds to either end up on _viz.website_ or as equal-billing, curated
  nextstrain.org builds we can vouch for.  How this interacts with community
  narratives was not discussed.

* **Removal of pathogens for which we or our collaborators cannot commit to
  maintaining an epidemic-wide perspective.**  This likely means that WNV and
  lassa are among the builds removed for the time being unless/until they
  become validated.


## A new _viz.website_

This site would let people upload JSON data files or source them from a GitHub
repo or GitHub Gist.  The existing services <https://bl.ocks.org> and
<https://figshare.com> were thrown out as analogues.  The service
<https://geojson.io> also came to my mind.

De-branding this from Nextstrain is seen as important to hopefully make it more
palatable to scientists who don't want to use Nextstrain but like our viz, as
well as distance it from claims of real-time global outlooks on disease.  There
would probably still be some very light, de-emphasized "Powered by Nextstrain"
message or similar at the bottom of pages.  But the auspice JSONs could be
produced by anything; not just augur.

Trevor threw out the name https://auspice.us (pronounced _auspicious_) and I
thought of https://phylo.graphics, but I'm going to use _viz.website_ here to
avoid the appearance of making a naming choice.

Sketches of what URLs for this might look like:

---                             | ------                                                            | -------             | ----------
