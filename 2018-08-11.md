### `nextstrain/base` image tagging?

To discuss further with Trevor early next week.

Currently:

  - `latest` — the master branch
  - `branch-$name` — branches other than master

Under consideration is:

  - `build-$timestamp` — every build from master (implementation on [`timestamp-tags` branch](https://github.com/nextstrain/docker-base/compare/master...timestamp-tags))
  - some tag based on Nextstrain component versions

It's still unclear if unique timestamped build tags are useful or not.


### Native build runner for CLI \[re: AWS Batch builds\]

Running builds outside of any container image, e.g. `nextstrain build --native
zika`, by relying on native installations of snakemake, augur, etc, as
[I've previously described](https://github.com/tsibley/blab-standup/blob/master/2018-07-19.md#build-execution-locations).

Work-in-progress on [`wip/native-runner` branch](https://github.com/nextstrain/cli/compare/master...wip/native-runner).

Lays groundwork for an AWS Batch runner.  The details of how to support a
second runner in the CLI are largely the same, but it's easier to do with
native execution since I don't also have to nail down the remote execution at
the same time.


### Write up a "Getting started" introduction to `nextstrain build` and modular builds

Based on topics I covered with Alli on Tuesday.

* Installation
    - pip
    - Docker CE
    - check-setup
* Cloning zika repo
* Structure of zika build
* Environment variables for RethinkDB and Amazon S3
* Running build
    - running everything
    - running specific steps
    - forcing steps / the whole build
    - cleaning out results
* Viewing results
    - locally
    - shared with others
* Deploying to staging

## 14-day forecast

In rough order of operations…

### Building remote URLs in addition to local dirs \[re: AWS Batch builds\]

Support for `nextstrain build git+https://github.com/nextstrain/zika`, for
example, as [I've previously described](https://github.com/tsibley/blab-standup/blob/master/2018-07-19.md#build-directory-locations).

This will be used by the AWS Batch builds, e.g. `nextstrain build --native
s3://build-bucket/…` is the command that will run _inside_ the AWS Batch
container.

This doesn't strictly have to happen before AWS Batch support.  However, it
seems like a nice thing to do first along the way rather than doing something
else in the interim for AWS Batch.  That way we don't have to do the interim
thing only to replace it later by this feature.  All of which assumes that
we're ok waiting on AWS Batch support for whatever time it takes to implement
this.  It's definitely possible that's not true.


### AWS Batch builds

Remote builds as [I've previously described](https://github.com/tsibley/blab-standup/blob/master/2018-07-19.md#remote-build-experience).

Thoughts on implementation:

  - Job is run in nextstrain/base container (as opposed to a
    nextstrain/base-aws-batch container with additional logic)

  - CLI generates an appropriate "run" or "entrypoint" script which is uploaded
    with the local build dir to S3 and becomes the command run inside the
    container.

  - This "run" script is responsible for any bookkeeping before and after the
    build, and ultimately runs the build using `nextstrain build --native`
    _inside_ the nextstrain/base container.

  - The "run" script may use `nextstrain deploy s3://build-bucket/unique/prefix/`
    to automatically make results visible on nextstrain.org (in addition to
    syncing them back to S3 for download by the computer which launched the job).

## Long-term outlook

In rough priority order…

### Roadmap + design documents

Consensus around a roadmap for Nextstrain and the project's priorities, with
short, middle, and long-term goals described in a brief, single-page document.

Detailed design documents ahead of development in order to lead discussion.
These not only describe **what** will change but also **why** we want the
change and **how** the proposed changes will be implemented.

Collaboration in person and on Slack, GitHub, etc with a point person
responsible for integrating and digesting discussion back into the design
documents and roadmaps.


### HI titers visualization

Port this from old Nextflu to Nextstrain/auspice so the WHO flu builds can use
our modern platform.  I'd like someone show me the existing thing first, but
this seems like a good task to work on as a well-scoped auspice component that
also moves us off the old platform.


### Authenticated instances of Nextstrain

Password-protected instances are simpler than multi-tenant private datasets in
the style of GitHub private repos.


### fauna / flora

Revamp our databasing.  This is a large project, but one to do at least for
ourselves, with an eye on others using it too as part of a genomic epi
database.

I'd tend toward:

  - PostgreSQL
  - GraphQL layered on top
  - Relational + JSON docs

See the [DB feature spec](https://github.com/nextstrain/fauna/wiki/DB-feature-spec)
doc on fauna's wiki.  We should leverage existing tools/schema/tech if we can,
such as [Chado](http://gmod.org/wiki/Chado), but be wary of taking on more
domain complexity than we need.
