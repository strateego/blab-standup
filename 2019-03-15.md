# or, Sketches of an API proposal for Samplify integration

## qPCR results

For each set of qPCR results, Samplify makes an authenticated HTTPS `POST`
request to a provided endpoint (e.g. `https://example.org/api/qpcr/results`).

The request has an `application/rdml+xml` Content-Type, with a body payload
containing an [RDML file](http://rdml.org).

Sample ids in the RDML should be linkable to material ids provided to the
presence/absence calls.


## qPCR presence/absence calls

For each set of presence/absence calls for qPCR targets in a sample, Samplify
makes an authenticated HTTPS `POST` request to a provided endpoint (e.g.
`https://example.org/api/qpcr/presence-absence-calls`).

The request has an `application/json` Content-Type, with a body payload like
the following:

    {
      // Unique identifiers (generated by Samplify and/or the qPCR instrument
      // software) from the <rdml>, <experiment>, and <run> elements which can
      // be used to join with an RDML file sent under separate cover.
      //
      "rdml_id": "...",
      "experiment_id": "...",
      "run_id": "...",

      "calls": [
        {
          // Unique identifier for this sample in the RDML file.
          "sample_id": "...",

          // Flu Study IDs of material provided by Lea/BBI
          "material": {
            "sample": "20e1d4a2",
            "aliquot": "3492492"
          },

          // Target name
          "target": "FluA",

          // Presence call: true, false, or null (indeterminate/unknown)
          "present": true
        },
        ...
      ]
    }


## Sequencing results

For each sequenced sample, Samplify makes an authenticated HTTPS `POST`
request to a provided endpoint (e.g. `https://example.org/api/sequence/reads`).

The request has an `application/json` Content-Type, with a body payload
like the following:

    {
      // Flu Study IDs of material provided by Lea/BBI
      "material": {
        "sample": "20e1d4a2",
        "aliquot": "3492492"
      },

      // The locations (URLs) of the demultiplexed FASTQ files for this
      // sequenced material.
      //
      // I'm not sure which Aspera product you're using, so the URLs might
      // use a different scheme (https://, ascp://, etc).
      //
      "reads": [
        "aspera://server/path/to/reads_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz",
        "aspera://server/path/to/reads_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz"
      ]
    }
