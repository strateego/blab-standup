# 3 October 2018
# or, A braindump

Several larger tasks I've been working on recently are merged or out for
review, so I'm thinking about what's next.

This is a braindump of tasks on my radar, roughly ordered by my sense of their
priority, at least for the first several.


## Flu study

* Sketch out how IRIDA might meet our informatics needs and what we'd need to
  build on top

* Research more about the [Genomics Virtual Laboratory](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4621043/?report=reader)

* Research more about [INNUENDO](http://www.innuendoweb.org/links)


## Nextstrain

* Review and contribute to the Roadmap


* auspice: More forgiving gene name handling to allow for underscores and
  hyphens ([issue #669](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/issues/669))


* Document how different components fit together, possibly in tandem with a
  glossary.

  For example, the CLI vs. augur vs. auspice vs. Snakemake vs. build repo vs.
  container image.


* Document how to 


* cli: Terminate AWS Batch build jobs on `^C` (`KeyboardInterrupt`)

  This avoids leaving jobs running remotely after the CLI has stopped
  monitoring them.


* cli: `--unattended` mode for AWS Batch builds

  With support for resuming/fetching results later using `nextstrain build
  --aws-batch --resume job-id zika-tutorial/`


* cli: Directory hashing of workdirs to save on S3 usage and upload time.

  I [prototyped a standalone hashdir implementation](https://gist.github.com/tsibley/acef98524e976eba5043b55f8f87bac2).


* cli: Improve Windows user experience ([issue #31](https://github.com/nextstrain/cli/issues/31))

  The user experience on Windows is currently poor and could use a bunch of
  improvement and documentation.


* Further documentation of augur and Nextstrain ecosystem.
  
  - How to run everything vs. specific steps
  - How to force specific steps to re-run vs. force the whole build to re-run
  - How to clean out results
  - Viewing results locally
  - Viewing results to share with others
  - Deploying to staging
  - Deploying to production


* CI testing of various pathogen builds on augur changes

  Unsure if these should be a separate check integrated into GitHub, or as part
  of the existing Travis builds.  Either way, they should probably not ultimately
  be part of the passing vs. failing determination, but merely informative for
  developers (because it's too hard to make the builds bulletproof in the face of
  augur changes).


* cli: Automatic `nextstrain build` reproducibility messaging.

  Something like "You can reproduce this analysis by running: ..."  This should
  only be approached after the [image tag handling (PR #30)](https://github.com/nextstrain/cli/pull/30)
  is merged.


* cli: [Remote build directory support](2018-07-19.md#build-directory-locations)


* cli: Singularity support
