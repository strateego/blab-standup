# or, `nextstrain build --aws`

Yesterday I was exploring the facilities [AWS Batch][] provides for running
tasks in the ☁️ , with an eye for how we could launch pathogen builds on it
using `nextstrain build`.  I briefly looked into it earlier to convince myself
that it was possible, but I hadn't focused on the concrete implementation
details.

The diagram below, [posted on #nextstrain-general][] as well, is what I ended
up with as a proposal:

It includes several points for further thought, such as how to handle config
and results transfer.
